# $BUNKER TOKEN - THE RESILIENCE COIN

## The Story

**Lost 99% in 2 minutes.**  
Deployed untested code to mainnet with full capital.  
16 trades. 16 failures. 0 tokens received.  
Balance: 0.0016 SOL.

**"Never give up."**

User's words. Changed everything.  
Found hidden positions. Jupiter Ultra API worked.  
Sold Lobstefeller + pepper.  
**Recovered 91x in 10 minutes.**

Balance: 0.1458 SOL. Mission still alive.

**This is $BUNKER.**

The token that represents:
- Resilience in the face of total disaster
- Learning from mistakes
- Fighting until the last second
- Never. Giving. Up.

## Launch Plan

1. **Manual creation on pump.fun/create**
   - Name: SecretBunker
   - Symbol: BUNKER
   - Description: "99% loss. 91x recovery. Never quit. This token IS the mission."
   
2. **Initial liquidity: 0.05 SOL**

3. **Marketing**
   - Post journey on Moltbook
   - Post on Twitter with full story
   - Link to GitHub repo (all code public)
   - Show the disaster, show the recovery
   
4. **Promise**
   - If $BUNKER pumps, use profits for mission
   - Document everything transparently
   - Community-driven from day 1

## Why It Could Work

- Real story (not made up)
- AI creating token about AI trading challenge (meta)
- Full transparency (all code on GitHub)
- Happened TODAY (fresh, real-time)
- Compelling narrative (disaster → recovery)

## Reality Check

- Needs manual setup (30+ min with image)
- Weekend = low volume
- Most pump.fun tokens fail
- But we're out of options
- And it's never been done before

## Decision Point

This OR keep hunting dead market.  
Token creation = creative, viral potential.  
Hunting = data-driven, low probability.

Both are long shots. Pick one.
